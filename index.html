                               this asmr is a complimation of sounds from NYUAD dorm rooms, capturing the day to day sounds that a student in NUAD will encounter.
                                it gives a break from the productivity culture and makes the viewer want to sit back and relax and maybe start flipping that book they always wanted to flip through or just cap and uncap those pens

                                onsidered a Domestic noir is clearly inspired by Woody Allen’s psychological thriller ‘Match Point’ (2005). I spent a good two hours and a little more watching it and at the end of it all, Gehraiyaan left me feeling absolutely nothing. The movie fails to make us feel even precious little for what all transpired on screen and feel totally fails to understand the motivations that move the characters.
