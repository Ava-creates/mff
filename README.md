Project Name: sounds of nyuad
<br>

Project Description: what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create.<br>
->the main concept was to build a minimalistic organised website with fixed color scheme, smooth flow and bits of animation to give more agency to the user.
<br>

Process: How did you go about implementing the concept.<br>
->I used a fixed color palette ( did not try to mix and match), a lot of divs for proper organisation. I primarily used css to create the rotate card affect and the transition in the about page with a little bit of javascript

Reflection/Evaluation: This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.<br>
->the pop-ups along timeline were an important part of the project and was supposed to be the key interactivity feature but it required more time since I started on that part late and am not familiar with javascript and hence I did not implement it. Instead, I tried to add interactivity to other components like the rotate in the information cards and transition in the about cards.
